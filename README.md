# wellio-playground
Place to test alternative code and demonstrate bugs outside the main wellio.js repo.

This is mostly a repo for note keeping and a place to move quickly without worrying about leaving bad code in a branch on wellio that I then accidentally merge.

## Demos

The top-level directories in this repository with `demo_` suffixes in their names are independent demo folders. Each holds a `index.html` file that builds a different demo.
